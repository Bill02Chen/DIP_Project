First run matlab code: smooth.m
In order in run this matlab code, there is a need to install a matlab package (Image Processing Toolbox).
You need to manually modify the input image path in this matlab code file.

Then run: python3 mainpart.py input_image_path

The output image is named as output.png

I also provide some images for you to test, they are in folder test

The function L0Smoothing.m is provided by the reference paper, thanks to their contribution.
